**Assignment1**

Here is a Maven Project which will Convert MySql Table Data to CSV File.

for making this project more statable I used SpringBoot Dependency Along with MySQL Dependency.

We just need to mention DataBase Name And Table Name in the Command line argument for a run this project.

Example - java -jar target/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar DB_name Table_name.

Task Details : - 

- [X]  Do development in Linux machine
- [X]  Create a MySQL table with your choice of schema
- [x]  Build a Java CLI 
- [ ]  Take all properties through configuration

Note : - 
All the values we are taking from Commandline arguments so I skipped values take from Application.Properties.
